# AGENTS.md – Simple Rules

1. **Sync the docs:** Whenever you change **any** file in the `code/` directory (add, remove, rename, or modify classes, functions, or scripts), you must **update the corresponding section in `README.md` in the same commit**.
2. **Self‑test new APIs:** Whenever you introduce a new class or function, create **and run** a minimal dummy test that exercises its core behaviour and asserts an expected output. Commit this test alongside the code change.

That’s it — keep the repo honest and self‑checking.
